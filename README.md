# 🚀 Rocjet Technologies Ltd

**Technology-first. Mobile-built. Founder-led.**

Hi, I’m **Caleb Wodi (Calchiwo)** — a 15-year-old Nigerian and the Founder & CEO of **Rocjet Technologies Ltd**.

Rocjet isn’t just a software company or a SaaS startup. It’s a **technology-first company** where I build platforms, mobile apps, offline games, AI solutions, and cybersecurity tools — all from my phone. This is my playground to explore, create, and launch platforms that solve real problems with simplicity and purpose.

## 🧠 What Rocjet Means to Me

I started Rocjet because I believe technology should be accessible and powerful — even if you’re just starting out with what you have.

I’m not here to build just “tools.” I’m building **platforms** — foundations where people can connect, create, and grow. It’s about impact, innovation, and pushing boundaries.

> “At 15, with just my phone and my ideas, I’m proving that you don’t need fancy setups to make something meaningful.”
