# 🚀 Rocjet Technologies Ltd

**Simple ideas. Useful tools. Built from a phone.**

Welcome to the GitHub home of **Rocjet Technologies Ltd**. It's a small **software company I started at 15**. I’m from Nigeria, and I build mobile-first tools using **just my Android phone**.

Everything here is coded from scratch. No fancy setup. Just me learning, building, and shipping useful things.

## 🧠 About Rocjet

I’m **Caleb Wodi**, also known as **Calchiwo**.

I started Rocjet to turn ideas into tools people can use.

> "You don’t need perfect tools to start. Just the courage to begin."

This is where I build, test, and share what I’m learning as a young developer.
